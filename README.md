# PyDirbuster

<h2 align="center">About The Project</h2>

<p align="left">
    Pydirbuster was a project created by me (Ducky#9982 on discord), It was aimed to increase the level i worked at while improving my mental and technical skillset, public for anybody's use just please credit me if you would like to publish it yourself. Will be updated regularly, such as to include subdomain fuzzing and deeper penetration with directory fuzzing. If you wish you can start scanning only within a specific directory in the url given by just adding that directory onto the url as you would normally in a web browser. Have fun and don't do anything too bad with this tool.
